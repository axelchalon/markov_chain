    "excerpt": "The future of Afghanistan as a viable democratic state, capable of providing security and a strong foundation for its people to prosper, is undermined by the widespread, systemic presence of corruption. Although the immediate prospects for peace in the country remain unclear, what is certain is that long-term stability cannot be secured unless a sustained effort is made to tackle corruption. Experience from post-conflict countries around the world shows that widespread corruption undermines the authority of the state and its institutions and provides fertile ground for criminal networks to develop and insurgents to operate. Corruption also deprives the poor and vulnerable of essential services and limits their access to justice. By weakening the bonds of trust between citizens and the state, it heightens the risk of conflict re-emerging.",

In Brazil, as in many countries around the world, it is possible to hide the beneficial owner of companies that are buying property. The research shows that more than 3,450 real estate titles are owned through 236 companies that are registered in secrecy jurisdictions and tax havens, including in the British Virgin Islands, the US state of Delaware and Uruguay.",

    "excerpt": "The ProZorro platform (electronic procurement system) was initiated in Kyiv in May 2014 by a group of anti-corruption activists that focused on developing an electronic procurement platform for all Ukrainian public agencies. Their goal was to provide an accessible public procurement solution to reduce corruption in public procurement in Ukraine. The ProZorro platform was established on a pro bono basis and it was co-developed by a diverse group of stakeholders – including Transparency International Ukraine, the private sector and government champions. The ProZorro platform was launched and started piloting electronic bidding in February 2015.\n\nThis case study seeks to assess how the multi-stakeholder co-creation approach affected the design and/or outcome of the e-procurement platform. In order to answer this question we conducted 17 in-depth interviews with activists, politicians, representatives of businesses and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), experts and software developers, all of whom actively participated in the creation of the new procurement system.",

    "excerpt": "The real estate market has long provided a way for individuals to secretly launder or invest stolen money and other illicitly gained funds. Not only do expensive apartments in New York, London or Paris raise the social status of their owners and enhance their luxurious lifestyles, but they are also an easy and convenient place to hide hundreds of millions of dollars from criminal investigators, tax authorities or others tracking criminal behaviour and the proceeds of crime.\n \nIn many such cases, property is purchased through anonymous shell companies or trusts without undergoing proper due diligence by the professionals involved in the deal. The ease with which such anonymous companies or trusts can acquire property and launder money is directly related to the insufficient rules and enforcement practices in attractive markets. The countries analysed in this study – Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States – have committed in different forums, such as through the FATF and the Group of 20 (G20), to do more to prevent and curb money laundering and terrorist-financing, including by regulating gatekeepers, such as real estate agents, lawyers and accountants, who may act as facilitators in transactions that can enable money laundering.\n\nThis report identifies the main problems related to real estate and money laundering in these four countries and finds that, despite international commitments, current rules and practices are inadequate to mitigate the risks and detect money laundering in the real estate sector.",

    "excerpt": "Financial systems depend on trust from citizens and businesses to function. A vital part of this trust is the belief that banks are not holding funds on behalf of corrupt individuals and organisations, criminals, or terrorists.\nIn recent years, the financial sector has provided ample reason to question this belief. The majority of large-scale corruption scandals, from Ukraine to Brazil, have featured banks transferring or managing funds for the perpetrators and their associates.\nTo reduce money-laundering risks and increase the systemic accountability of the financial sector, this report recommends that financial sector supervisors should make a standard set of supervisory and enforcement statistics public on a yearly basis, including the number of banks inspected, the number of regulatory breaches found, and the number and value of sanctions imposed.\nThe report’s findings show that currently just 1 in 3 such statistics is publicly available across the 12 countries assessed. Regular data on anti-money laundering supervision would allow for greater oversight by citizens, media, and national and international authorities.",

    "excerpt": "Corruption and inequality feed off each other, creating a vicious circle between corruption, unequal distribution of power in society, and unequal distribution of wealth. As the Panama Papers showed, it is still far too easy for the rich and powerful to exploit the opaqueness of the global financial system to enrich themselves at the expense of the public good.\n\nBased on expert opinion from around the world, the Corruption Perceptions Index measures the perceived levels of public sector corruption worldwide. The findings are less than encouraging. Not a single country comes close to top marks, while over 120 countries score below 50 on the scale of 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). This means less than a third of countries are even above the midpoint.\n\nCorruption hurts all countries. In our index’s lower-scoring countries, people frequently face situations of bribery and extortion, rely on basic services that have been undermined by the misappropriation of funds, and confront official indifference when seeking redress from authorities that are on the take. In higher-scoring countries the situation may seem less obvious in the daily lives of citizens, but closed-door deals, illicit finance, and patchy law enforcement exacerbate many forms of corruption at home and abroad. “We do not have the luxury of time,” says Ugaz. “Corruption needs to be fought with urgency, so that the lives of people across the world improve”.",

In its mapping of corruption risks, the study both describes perceived risks, as perceived by the stakeholders consulted, as well as specific examples of corruption. It also captures many of the good-practice mitigation measures being utilised. It was not, however, an investigation of any individual agency or group of agencies; nor does it attempt to quantify or estimate the overall percentage of losses due to corruption.",

The reasons are manifold and complex, but are driven to a large degree by the belief that traditional democratic institutions – governments, political parties – are failing to deliver on promises of prosperity and equal opportunity and that they cannot be trusted. Corruption is central to this story – both the failure of governments to properly address corruption and their complicity in corrupt or clientelist schemes. It has become impossible to ignore systemic corruption in the way business influences politics, as shown by the on-going trial of 37 executives and politicians in Spain who are alleged to have been involved in a “kickbacks-for-contracts” scheme for nearly a decade.ii Examples such as this can give ordinary citizens the impression that public spending and public policy is distorted to favour the few over the many.",

To enhance comparability, the company sample for this report is primarily based on the 2013 edition of the Transparency in Corporate Reporting: Assessing Emerging Market Multinationals report.\nThis report assesses the public disclosure practices of emerging market multinationals based on three dimensions: first, the reporting of key elements of their anti-corruption programmes; second, the disclosure of their company structures and holdings; and, third, the disclosure of key financial information on a country-by-country basis. This information was gathered from corporate websites and other publicly available sources by a team of Transparency International researchers.",

    "excerpt": "In the past decades, Latin America has seen an explosion of government social spending targeting human development for the region’s poorest citizens. Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programmes, which link cash payments to the provision of education and health care, have been widely adopted.  Given that these programmes are targeting families living in extreme conditions of vulnerability, it is essential that they are designed and implemented in a way that ensures that the programme funds get to the right people, for the right purposes and at the right time, free of political abuse or corruption. Unfortunately, as our regional report indicates, these social programmes can sometimes lack effective transparency, accountability and participation mechanisms. At best, this can lead to lack of understanding about benefit delivery and conditions, and a programme that is less responsive to the actual needs of intended beneficiaries.  At worst, can mean the abuse of power for political or private gain by politicians and other programme stakeholders, culminating in extortion, clientelism,  or the loss of benefits by those most in need.  This report provides a set of evidence-based findings regarding common weaknesses found in the integrity mechanisms of selected CCT programmes in Latin America along with several recommendations for ensuring that programmes in the future operate with the most effective standards of transparency and accountability, especially accountability to those most in need – the intended beneficiaries.",

    "excerpt": "“Integrity Pacts” are a tool developed by Transparency International for tackling corruption in public procurement. They have been applied in many countries around the world for over 20 years. There are even countries in which the use of the Integrity Pact has become part of the law or governmental procedures, such as in India or the “Social Witness” in Mexico. In other countries, the adoption of an Integrity Pact for specific public procurement projects is a result of strong advocacy efforts from civil society. Many guides, manuals and handbooks on the topic have been published. The most well-known is Integrity Pacts in Public Procurement: An Implementation Guide, which is a hands-on, practical guide designed to familiarise government officials in charge of public procurement processes with Integrity Pacts, and to provide them with the tools and ideas to apply them. This document will be referenced regularly throughout the present document.\n\nThe purpose of this publication – which was written collaboratively in only four days – is to contribute to the already existing literature on Integrity Pacts, but from a civil society perspective. This document is based on the experience of the Transparency International global network. Representatives from 10 Transparency International chapters were brought together to review the challenges that are faced in the different stages of Integrity Pacts, and to document the alternatives they have found to overcome these challenges. These include challenges from the moment Integrity Pact implementation is being considered, until the time when the final results are evaluated. This guide does not intend to convince anyone of the usefulness of Integrity Pacts: rather, it is designed for those who are considering implementing, or have already decided to implement, an Integrity Pact. It is for those who are new to Integrity Pacts – who have questions about where, when and how to start implementing them.",

    "excerpt": "For Transparency International the London Anti-Corruption Summit, taking place on May 12, 2016, provides a unique opportunity for global leaders to adopt concrete, ambitious commitments that can be implemented over the next five years.\n\nThis briefing sets out just some of the most important specific actions and agreements that are needed for the Summit to be a success. The Summit is also expected to put forward additional initiatives that may help ensure that a comprehensive approach is taken to tackling corruption. At the very least, the summit must deliver on:\n\npreventing corruption\nending impunity for those who benefit from corrupt acts and\nempowering and supporting citizens to report corruption\n\n\nWorld leaders must guarantee the commitments will be implemented over a defined period of time and that progress (or the lack of it) will be monitored. Once the dust has settled, global leaders cannot be allowed to walk away with yet another lofty communique of high principled intent and no game plan for implementation.\n\nA key prerequisite for a successful Summit is that the host Government of the United Kingdom (UK) gets its own house in order to ensure credibility on the global stage. The UK has many challenges with domestic corruption to address, including risks identified in areas such as political funding, peer appointments, police corruption, procurement and local government.\n\nThe UK should also require its own Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies, which host hundreds of thousands of secret companies and legal entities, to publish time-bound plans of action for publishing registries that show the names of the real people – beneficial owners – of the companies and legal entities incorporated there.",

These countries are Jordan, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Palestine, Libya, Iraq, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the Comoros. Many of these countries have made legislative amendments to harmonise their national laws with the requirements of the convention, and some of them have drawn up strategic plans to fight corruption. The Arab Anti-Corruption and Integrity Network (ACINET) was established to coordinate the efforts of the integrity and anti-corruption bodies in Arab countries. Recently, no less than four Arab countries have undergone a review of the extent of their adherence to the convention. Despite these achievements, the results on the ground in the field of strengthening integrity and fighting corruption in the Arab region are still modest compared to other regions of the world.",

    "excerpt": "This report presents the National Integrity System assessment of Libya based on research undertaken between April 2014 and November 2014. It is the first of its kind in Libya, a country in a phase of transformation at all levels of the political landscape since the revolution in 2011. The study describes the status of the Libyan National Integrity System during April – November 2014. Significant turmoil erupted in May 2014 and increased following the parliamentary election in June 2014 with armed groups fighting for control of the capital and other areas of Libya. \nLibya faces a serious risk of territorial disintegration, where Islamists control the west and Benghazi, and the more liberal government asserts its control in the far east, supported by armed federalists. Various regions are considering breaking away from Libya and the security situation is in a very poor state.",

Although asset declarations have been utilised as an anti-corruption tool on a larger scale since the 1970s, the topic acquired renewed international focus with the passage of UNCAC, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2003. UNCAC created an international legal basis for states to require public officials to declare their assets. Transparency International commissioned this report as a peer-reviewed scoping paper examining current best practices in asset disclosure systems. The original research provides an evidence base for a comparative view of country-level systems via National Reports in Egypt, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Tunisia and Yemen.",

    "excerpt": "Sport is a global phenomenon engaging billions of people and generating annual revenues of more than US$145 billion. Problems in the governance of sports organisations, the fixing of matches and the staging of major sporting events have spurred action on many fronts. Attempts to stop corruption in sport, however, are still at an early stage.\n\nThe Global Corruption Report (GCR) on sport is the most comprehensive analysis of sports corruption to date. It consists of more than 60 contributions from leading experts in the fields of corruption and sport, from sports organisations, governments, multilateral institutions, sponsors, athletes, supporters, academia and the wider anti-corruption movement.\n\nThis GCR provides essential analysis for understanding the corruption risks in sport, focusing on sports governance, the business of sport, the planning of major events and match-fixing. It highlights the significant work that has already been done and presents new approaches to strengthening integrity in sport. In addition to measuring transparency and accountability, the GCR gives priority to participation, from sponsors to athletes to supporters – an essential to restoring trust in sport.\n\nDownload the full book below, or access individual articles here.

The new democratically-elected government has taken power against a backdrop of withdrawing international forces and recent reports of a worsening security situation in the country. While the immediate prospects for peace remain unclear, what is certain is that long term stability cannot be secured unless a sustained effort is made to tackle corruption in the country. Experience from post-conflict countries around the world shows that widespread corruption undermines the authority of the state and its institutions and provides fertile ground for criminal networks to develop and insurgents to operate. Corruption also deprives the poor and vulnerable of essential services and limits their access to justice. By weakening the bonds of trust between citizens and the state, it heightens the risk of conflict re-emerging.",

That said, since the establishment of the UNCAC Review Mechanism, there has been debate amongst States Parties regarding the extent and methods by which civil society should be involved in UNCAC review and implementation efforts. The most notable manifestation of this debate is the exclusion of CSOs from the UNCAC Implementation Review Group responsible for overseeing the review mechanism. As this report demonstrates, over the first cycle of the UNCAC Review Mechanism, from 2010-15, the value of civil society participation has been demonstrated in practice, with CSOs involved in 85 per cent of the 114 in-country visits undertaken during this period,3 and many contributing their inputs via detailed UNCAC Civil Society Review Reports4 and other helpful technical commentary. \n\nThis report reflects upon civil society’s strong capacities to contribute to anti-corruption efforts, highlighting good practices, lessons learned and opportunities for improved government-civil society collaboration. These reflections have led to the recommendations below that were addressed to the 6th UNCAC Conference of States Parties in November 2015 and aim to assist UNCAC States Parties in identifying areas where they can take concrete action.",

Shockingly, we estimate that nearly 75 million people have paid a bribe in the past year – some of these to escape punishment by the police or courts, but many also forced to pay to get access to the basic services that they desperately need. A majority of Africans perceive corruption to be on the rise and think that their government is failing in its efforts to fight corruption; and many also feel disempowered as regards to taking action against corruption. In Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Liberia and Ghana citizens are the most negative about the scale of corruption in their country.",

    "excerpt": "Each year FIFA hands out millions of dollars to football associations (FAs). The money is generated from two main sources: sponsors and broadcasters. They pay FIFA money because billions of fans follow football, watch it on TV, and buy football products such as balls and kits. It is the positive association with football that sponsors value and the global reach of the World Cup they pay for. The FAs generate additional revenues from local sponsorship deals, government grants and ticket sales.\n\nTo identify potential corruption risks in world football, Transparency International looked at the information that is publicly available on websites about how the 209 FAs and the regional football confederations are run. Do they publish financial accounts and report on their activities? Do they have statutes and codes of conduct? Most do not. We set the bar for transparency at a very low level. Even FAs with a top score still need to reveal much more to the public about their organisation and how they spend the cash that pours in from FIFA headquarters and their own revenue generating activities.",

    "excerpt": "Major corruption scandals hitting the news often share key commonalities: the people at the centre of the scandal use a complex web of anonymous companies, trusts and other legal entities situated across multiple jurisdictions to transfer and hide their illicitly sourced funds. Perpetrators often use the services of professional middle-men and banks to move or conceal money and the funds often end up in the hands of other professionals, such as real estate agents or luxury goods providers, making the proceeds of corruption appear legitimate. \n\nIn recent years commitments have been made at the highest level to tackle the misuse of these corporate vehicles and trusts, and to increase transparency around who ultimately owns, controls or is benefitting from them. At their Brisbane Summit in November 2014, the Group of 20 (G20) leaders adopted High-Level Principles on Beneficial Ownership Transparency, describing financial transparency as a “high priority” issue. The G20 principles build upon the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, which set the current global standards for anti-money laundering. The FATF recommendations were strengthened in 2012, which means that some countries may still be in the process of strengthening their own frameworks accordingly. \n\nIt is crucial that the G20 principles are now transposed into law and implemented effectively by member countries. In July 2015 Transparency International published a Technical Guide13 that outlines in detail how governments can ensure their legal framework is in line with each of the 10 G20 principles to more effectively tackle money laundering. The current report, Just for Show? Reviewing G20 Promises on Beneficial Ownership now assesses the extent to which G20 members are fulfilling their legal and regulatory commitments implicit in the G20 principles one year after their adoption. This baseline analysis identifies areas of strength and weakness in the current beneficial ownership transparency framework of each G20 member country so that progress can be monitored in the years to come. It draws on data collected from expert questionnaires focusing on the key components of each G20 principle. \n\nThis report aims to encourage a conversation in each country on where laws can be improved to strengthen the beneficial ownership regulatory framework. Alongside this report we also publish individual summaries for each G20 member, which provide more detailed analysis on an individual basis. The combined findings should be used to help identify which concrete legal provisions should be adopted in order to adhere to the commitments within the G20 principles. Where they exist, Transparency International encourages competent authorities, such as tax and banking regulators, as well as law enforcement agencies, to ensure the strong legal basis is effectively enforced within these countries to close the tap on illicit financial flows to and from their jurisdiction.",

The elimination of widespread corruption was one of the key\nissues galvanising Egyptians during the 25 January revolution. Hopes were high when the Mubarak regime toppled in 2011 that the time had come for an accountable, transparent and fair system of governance. This report provides a timely insight into the extent to which those hopes have been fulfilled and a roadmap for future reform, in another period of transition and uncertainty, following the removal of Mohamed Morsi by the military in July 2013 in response to large demonstrations. The NIS does this through assessing the current situation within its historical context since 2011. Its message is clear – progress needs to be faster, key institutions need reform and political actions need to focus on building a transparent, accountable and integrity-focused governance system.",

The G20 principles draw on the G8 Action Plan Principles to Prevent the Misuse of Companies and Legal Arrangements, adopted in the United Kingdom in 2013. The adoption of the G20 principles just one year later dramatically increased both the number and diversity of countries that have signalled their commitment at the highest political level to tackle beneficial ownership secrecy.\n\nThe G20 principles build upon the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, the current global standards for anti-money laundering. However the principles offer flexibility for G20 countries to implement them according to their own legal frameworks. In order for the principles to be most effective in tackling money laundering, they must be implemented as soon as possible. Equally, the language that provides for flexibility between different jurisdictions should not be misinterpreted to allow countries to settle for standards that fall to the lowest common denominator.\n\nThis technical guide takes each of the 10 G20 principles in turn and describes the current applicable international standards. In cases where the principles provide for flexibility in regard to interpretation and implementation, or in cases where Transparency International considers that the standards may not be sufficiently strong, the additional steps that countries should take in order for a principle to be implemented most effectively are also stated. At the end of each section, a summary of recommendations on how to implement the principle is provided.",

    "excerpt": "There are many barriers that prevent individuals from speaking up. Public trust in the ability of institutions to deal with corruption is low and reporting channels are often unclear or unreliable. Laws that protect whistleblowers are poorly implemented or non-existent and citizens often do not know their rights or how to effectively exercise them.\nThis report provides examples of how Transparency International has worked with citizens to challenge the assumption that nothing can be done about corruption. Drawing primarily on the experience of seven European Union (EU) countries (the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania and Luxembourg) participating in a multi-country project to empower citizens to speak up against corruption and wrongdoing, we highlight how we can work effectively with individuals to break the corruption cycle.",

    "excerpt": "This report examines the practice of lobbying and the attempts to regulate it in 19 European countries and within the three core EU institutions. It comes at a time when public trust in government is at an all-time low and the practice of lobbying is widely associated with secrecy and unfair advantage. It also comes at a moment when an increasing number of governments in Europe are promising to tackle the problem of undue influence in politics, and the need for good government is particularly pressing given the range of economic, social and political challenges currently faced by European countries and EU institutions.\n\nLobbying is an integral part of a healthy democracy, closely related to universal values such as freedom of speech and the right to petition of government. It allows for various interest groups to present their views on\npublic decisions that may come to affect them. It also has the potential to enhance the quality of decision-making by providing channels for the input of expertise on increasingly technical issues to legislators and decision makers.\n\nDespite this, multiple scandals throughout Europe demonstrate that without clear and enforceable rules, a select number of voices with better resourcing and contacts can come to dominate political decision-making.\n\nView our interactive map to explore the results and see national reports.",

The corrupt often turn to banks and other financial institutions to legitimise their monies, bringing them into the formal financial system. Financial institutions can prevent these flows from ever entering the system. They can do this by effectively identifying perspective investors and clients as “Politically Exposed Persons” (PEPs): individuals who have held or are in public office. By flagging potential PEPs, banks are then able to do additional checks on the source of funds and to ensure that they are free of corruption.",

    "excerpt": "This is the tenth annual progress report on OECD Anti-Bribery Convention enforcement by Transparency International, the global coalition against corruption. The OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, adopted in 1997, requires each signatory country to make foreign bribery a crime for which individuals and enterprises are responsible. The Convention is a key instrument for curbing the export of corruption globally because the 41 signatory countries are responsible for approximately two-thirds of world exports and almost 90 per cent of total foreign direct investment outflows. The OECD Working Group on Bribery, which represents the 41 Parties to the Convention, conducts a follow-up monitoring programme under which 9-10 countries are reviewed each year.\n\nTransparency International’s annual report on foreign bribery enforcement presents an independent assessment on the status of enforcement in all of the Parties to the Convention with the exception of Latvia, where the Convention entered into force only in 2014. In our methodology section we address the differences between our methodology and that of the OECD Working Group on Bribery. \n\nView our online presentation of the country-level details at www.transparency.org/exporting_corruption",

The primary aim of the assessment is therefore to evaluate the effectiveness of Vanuatu’s institutions in preventing and fighting corruption and in fostering transparency and integrity. In addition, it seeks to promote the assessment process as a springboard for action among the government and anti-corruption community in terms of policy reform, evidence-based advocacy or further in-depth evaluations of specific governance issues. This assessment should serve as a basis for key stakeholders in Vanuatu to advocate for sustainable and effective reform.",

The other two branches of power that creates a system of checks and balances, namely, the judiciary and the legislature, are comparatively weak. The pillars that perform the watchdog functions (civil society, media, and political parties) are rated as the weakest links. Business is not very strong either. The institutions of Ombudsman and the Chamber of Accounts do not enjoy much independence, as they lack the power of enforcement, but they rate relatively high due to professional performance. The public sector was rated rather well, but delays in reforms in public procurement brought the overall score of the public service somewhat down.",

The four countries have different levels of development and each has a distinct culture but they all share at least one dynamic: a large and growing percentage of the population consists of young people in the 15-30 age group. Transparency International national chapters in the Asia Pacific region recognise that, in order to engage their ever-growing populations of young people in the fight against corruption, they need to first better understand young people’s attitudes, experiences and interests. Transparency International designed the Youth Integrity Survey to understand what “integrity” means to young people in the region and to understand how they experience and react to corruption. We are convinced that the fact that young people interviewed other young people on their views about corruption makes the findings all the more reliable. Transparency International chapters in each of the four countries produced national reports based on their own Youth Integrity Survey results that provide more in-depth analysis at the country level.

While none of the institutions assessed were found to be free from corruption risks, this report focuses in particular on the judiciary and anti-corruption agencies as critical actors in the fight against corruption. It highlights common challenges in the region and presents the governments of South Asia with a clear set of urgent priorities which need to be addressed in order to translate their anti-corruption rhetoric into concrete action.

It consists of a process that includes an agreement between a government or government agency (‘the authority’) and all bidders for a public sector contract, setting out rights and obligations to the effect that neither side will pay, offer, demand or accept bribes; nor will bidders collude with competitors to obtain the contract, or bribe representatives of the authority while carrying it out. An independent monitor who oversees IP implementation and ensures all parties uphold their commitments under the IP brings transparency and invaluable oversight to all stakeholders in a contracting process, from the authority to the public. With this implementation manual, we aim to help leaders and champions within their own governments across the world who are determined to overcome corruption in public contracting. This manual is a hands-on, practical guide to familiarise government officials in charge of public procurement processes with the Integrity Pact and to provide them with tools and ideas for its application.",

    "excerpt": "Recognising the role of whistleblowing in corruption-fighting efforts, many countries have pledged to enact whistleblower protection laws through international conventions. And, ever more governments, corporations and non-profit organisations around the world are putting whistleblower procedures in place. It is essential, however, that these policies provide accessible disclosure channels for whistleblowers, meaningfully protect whistleblowers from all forms of retaliation, and ensure that the information they disclose can be used to advance needed reforms.\n\nTo help ensure that whistleblowers are afforded proper protection and disclosure opportunities, the principles presented here serve as guidance for formulating new and improving existing whistleblower legislation. They should be adapted to an individual country’s political, social and cultural contexts, and to its existing legal frameworks. They take into account lessons learned from existing laws and their implementation in practice, and have been shaped by input from whistleblower experts, government officials, academia, research institutes and NGOs from all regions. These principles will be updated and refined as experiences with legislation and practices continue to unfold.",

The report dedicates a section to the performance of companies from the BRICS. This is of interest in view of their importance within emerging markets and in the world economy as a whole.",

At the same time, education serves as a means to strengthen personal integrity and is a critical tool to address corruption effectively. \n\nThe Global Corruption Report is Transparency International’s flagship publication, bringing the expertise of the anti-corruption movement to bear on a specific corruption issue or sector.

    "excerpt": "This report highlights the strengths and weaknesses of current election campaign financing legislation and its implementation in four countries – Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia (FYR) and Serbia. It also examines some aspects of annual political party financing in Albania. In addition, the report details promising practices in the region and makes recommendations for reform.\n\nThe report covers eight dimensions of election campaign financing which are crucial for ensuring transparency and reducing the risk of corruption and abuse of resources during election campaigns. These dimensions are: reporting to the oversight agency; depth of reporting; reliability of reporting; public disclosure; prevention; sanctions; state oversight, and public oversight.",

Efforts are needed around Europe to lift the shroud off of lobbying through stronger controls and sanctions, mandatory lobbying registers, and regulation of the “revolving door” between the public and private sectors.",

Instead of serving as beacons of democracy, the lack of integrity among political parties creates opportunities for undue influence, ethics violations and corruption. In European countries like Greece, Ireland, Italy and Spain, over 80 per cent of those surveyed view political parties in their countries as “corrupt” or “very corrupt.” Such high levels of perceived corruption can be linked to the increasingly negative influence that unregulated party and campaign financing have had on countries’ political processes and decisions. Political leaders, their parties and the public must respond to these integrity deficits by building the transparency and accountability of political parties.",

    "excerpt": "Public procurement systems across the European Union (EU) need to be robust, transparent and open to public monitoring. Only then can governments, bidders and contractors be held to account for how public money is spent, and corruption can be prevented. Corruption siphons off public funds, obstructs the functioning of the single market, and distorts fair competition. For these reasons, it is vital for the EU to ensure public procurements are sound, transparent and accountable. Public procurement at the EU-level is currently being reviewed; the inclusion of strong anti-corruption provisions is a way of increasing efficiency and creating the potential for substantial and immediate cost-savings. This is particularly urgent given the European sovereign-debt crisis, crippled economic activity across the region and national austerity measures that have made it necessary to make each Euro count. Only a strong and effective legal framework and strict enforcement practices can guarantee such a scenario.",

The OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, adopted in 1997, requires each signatory country to make foreign bribery a crime. It is a key instrument for curbing the export of corruption globally because the 39 signatory countries are responsible for two-thirds of world exports and three-quarters of foreign investment. The OECD Working Group on Bribery conducts a follow-up monitoring programme which reviews the parties’ implementation of the Convention’s provisions. Nine to ten country reviews are issued each year.\n\nOur annual progress reports represent an independent assessment of the status of OECD Convention enforcement, based on reports from our national chapters in 37 OECD Convention countries (excluding Iceland and Russia). Countries are classified in four enforcement categories this year: Active, Moderate, Little and No enforcement.",

However, even though the pillars score well or very well in terms of points, the study also uncovers weaknesses within most of the pillars. Some weaknesses are to be found in the legislation, while others are linked to practice. The extent and the severity of the weaknesses vary.",

En outre, lesautorités fédérales n'ont toujours pas, malgré plusieurs tentatives, mis en place un dispositif d'alerte (whistleblowing) .

    "excerpt": "The National Integrity System (NIS) assessment approach provides a framework which anti-corruption organisations can use to analyse both the extent and causes of corruption in a given country as well as the effectiveness of national anti-corruption efforts. This analysis is undertaken via a consultative approach, involving the key anti-corruption agents in government, civil society, the business community and other relevant sectors with a view to building momentum, political will and civic pressure for relevant reform initiatives. The assessment makes use of the concept of the National Integrity System (NIS), which has been developed and promoted by TI as part of its holistic approach to countering corruption. The NIS consists of the principle institutions and actors that contribute to integrity, transparency and accountability in a society.",

Italy's National Integrity System is far from robust, with an average NIS score of 55.04%. Corruption is able to flourish almost everywhere, as state institutions enjoy considerable autonomy, which does not correspond to standards of accountability and integrity. The report shows that it easy to circumvent mechanisms put in place to protect integrity by taking advantage of complex regulation, difficult access to information, and poor evaluation systems. Many governance institutions – in particular the Executive, Legislative and Judicial powers, as well as the Media – have been affected by conflict of interest.",

Naszej ocenie podlegała więc przede wszystkim jakość funkcjonowania trzynastu podstawowych filarów, na których docelowo powinien się opierać ten system, w tym między innymi władzy ustawodawczej, władzy wykonawczej, organów ścigania czy organizacji pozarządowych, oraz ogólnych uwarunkowań natury ekonomicznej, społecznej, kulturowej i politycznej.",

The general profile of corruption in Poland allows us to claim that it is not a phenomenon of dramatic proportions or one that threatens the foundations of the state and the social order in Poland.

Second, some institutions are marketed as anticorruption fighters, when actually their primary functions are different or have changed over time. Finally, another paradox has been demonstrated by the anticorruption activities in Bulgaria: the continuing reforms aimed at tackling corruption have not brought back the trust of the people in institutions.",

    "excerpt": "The National Integrity System (NIS) assessment approach provides a framework which anti-corruption organisations can use to analyse both the extent and causes of corruption in a given country as well as the effectiveness of national anti-corruption efforts. The sixteen assessed pillars in the Slovak National Integrity System could be divided into two groups based on their performance: strong or weak pillars. Such division allows us to cluster the pillars into two sets of institutions possessing, in some extent, common features. Indicators of integrity and accountability in practice are very low in majority of pillars. This shows, together with the lack of independence in practice, that implementation of existing rules and legal frameworks are the major downsides of the NIS in Slovakia.",

In accordance with this tradition, Finnish society functions in a formalrational manner. For the integrity system, this means that if there is legislation on a subject, it usually also works in practice.",

Its resources and independence are decisive for ensuring its integrity and, both in law and practice assessed as creating a huge vulnerability of the whole system. The public procurement system is also at risk, as the practice shows there are constant and many times undiscovered breaches of law.",

Studiet undersøger det nationale integritetssystem, som er summen af de institutioner, der arbejder for at styrke integritet og god regeringsførelse blandt statsansatte og private firmaer.

Il constitue la partie française d’une initiative de dimension européenne soutenue par la Commission Européenne1. L’objectif de cette initiative est d’évaluer le dispositif anti-corruption - le « Système National d’Intégrité » ou « SNI » - de 26 pays2 dans le but de promouvoir des réformes durables et efficaces. L’enjeu est d’importance. Selon l’Eurobaromètre 20093, 78% des citoyens européens estiment en effet que la corruption représente un problème réel dans leur pays. En France, cette opinion atteint 73%.",

    "excerpt": "CRINIS is an assessment tool that evaluates legislative systems and studies the practices of key actors involved in political finance. It aims to identify gaps and shortcomings in political financing systems, with the objective of promoting transparency in political party funding. It is premised on the conviction that transparency is a prerequisite for monitoring money in politics. In the Western Balkans, the assessment carried out in 2010-2011 has focused on the annual, non-electoral funding of political parties in Albania, Croatia, Kosovo, FYR Macedonia and Serbia. All the countries under review have undergone important legislative and institutional changes in political financing in recent years. Further substantial legislative changes were introduced in 2011 in Albania, Croatia and Serbia. These new frameworks incorporate some of the provisions on improvement of supervision and disclosure, but have not been in place long enough to enable full assessment of their implementation.\n\nThe regional report presents overall cross country findings of the research on regular funding of political parties and provides comparative analysis, as well as recommendations for addressing the identified shortcomings. More detailed information on evaluation of party financing systems is provided in individual country reports.",

Effects of such plans are an essential part of any political and especially preelection controversy. In the political debate and effort to formally meet European standards, it is often neglected that institutions of society and their anti-corruption potential are the key to longterm, sustainable and lasting fight against corruption.\n\nFor this reason the NIS analysis is extremely important as an impartial expert assessment of the vulnerability of social institutions and their potential for combating corruption. The Project ‘National Integrity System Assessment for Serbia’ (NIS) was made possible by the support of the EU Delegation in Serbia and the Fund for an Open Society, Serbia.",

    "excerpt": "Transparency International (TI) has long held that the most damaging impact of corruption is the diversion of basic resources from poor people. Corruption in humanitarian aid is the most egregious form of this, as it deprives the most vulnerable poor people, the victims of natural disasters and civil conflicts, of essential life-saving resources. Humanitarian assistance aims to save lives and alleviate the suffering of people in times of crisis. Yet these noble ambitions do not immunise emergency responses from corrupt abuse. There were numerous examples of corruption during the massive Asian tsunami humanitarian response, and examples of substantial diversion of aid resources have been reported recently in Afghanistan, Iraq, Liberia and Somalia. In response to this concern, TI launched a programme in 2005 to diagnose corruption risks specific to humanitarian operations and to develop a set of good practices aimed at mitigating those risks. The first, diagnostic phase culminated in the publication of a report on Mapping the Risks of Corruption in Humanitarian Action, in 2006. We hope that this handbook will offer guidance and support to the many people in the humanitarian sector who devote their lives to alleviating the suffering of the most vulnerable people. The handbook is dedicated to their work, to their resilience and courage to support those who are most in need: the victims of natural disasters and civil conflict.",

    "excerpt": "Anti-corruption hotlines provide a key channel for governments to receive complaints from individuals who have come into contact with or been victims of corruption. Increasingly, hotlines are being valued as a channel for citizen redress and as a barometer of the success of government anti-corruption efforts. They provide for broad feedback to governments from civil society on how well policies and institutions are working, where breakdowns occur and where responses are needed. As a service, hotlines are similar to community audits and legal advice centres in offering a means to cross-check whether campaign pledges and government promises are producing \nresults. Yet their success in combating corruption is dependent on a number of operational, administrative, institutional and political factors — each of which this paper will attempt to address by drawing on examples from Azerbaijan, Czech Republic, Kenya and Moldova.",

The Global Corruption Report 2009 provides a platform for combining refl ections on practical experience with rigorous analysis and a forward-looking perspective on the reform of policy and practice.

It equips young citizens with the knowledge and skills to thrive in their country's economy and to participate fully in society. It is a cornerstone of economic and social development, a human right under international law and a constitutional guarantee in most countries.\nBut in reality education is often characterised by poor quality and unequal access. For example, a region-wide survey of Africa’s education system showed more than 50 percent of respondents signalling numerous challenges to getting a basic education. Classroom overcrowding, poorly maintained primary schools, absent teachers, lack of textbooks and supplies, and unacceptably high fees and expenses were just some of the problems cited. When it comes to higher education, access in many countries depends more on the parents' purse and social status than the talent, effort and merit of the student. Unfortunately, corruption tends to be one of the principal reasons behind all of these problems.",

As captured in the comments of the OECD Secretary-General, there is a growing sentiment that poor corporate governance is one of the forces to blame. It allowed the transparency, accountability and integrity of companies to be compromised and for abuses to go unchecked, particularly on matters of corruption.",

It is hindering the water sector’s potential to serve as a catalyst for national development and instead has made water the source of stagnation in the lives of many. Every year, students suffering from water-related ailments around the world miss an estimated 443 million school days.

    "excerpt": "Much of the world’s business is carried out by small and medium enterprises, especially in emerging economies. This edition recognises that SMEs in many societies are frequently confronted with the problem of bribery. As smaller companies with limited resources SMEs face challenges in resisting and countering such pressures. Also, there are growing requirements made by large international companies for their suppliers to show evidence they have appropriate anti-bribery policies and systems in place. This edition aims to set out in a clear and direct manner the process by which smaller businesses can develop an anti-bribery programme relevant to their size and resources. Countering bribery is good business practice. It can help build reputation, especially with customers, and it can reduce risks. By building strong anti-bribery cultures SMEs can successfully challenge and resist bribery.",

A total of 40 nations — 30 OECD governments and 10 non- member states — have endorsed them as a basic component of responsible corporate conduct for multinational enterprises (MNEs) that are based in or operating from their territories.\nWhile the Guidelines are voluntary for companies, they have been useful for promoting corporate accountability. Adhering governments are bound by inter-governmental agreement to respond to complaints arising from alleged violations. Civil society has effectively used the Guidelines to draw attention to such irresponsible behaviour and trigger corrective actions.",

The tragic paradox, that many resource-rich countries remain poor, stems from a lack of data on oil and gas revenues and how they are managed. The 2008 Report on Revenue Transparency of Oil and Gas Companies evaluates 42 leading international and national oil and gas companies operating in 21 countries, based on the transparency of their reporting, particularly on payments made to governments for resource extraction rights.",

When these features are missing, the sector’s integrity is eroded and corruption is given a fertile ground on which to flourish. In the case of water, corruption has become a driver of the sector’s crisis. Overuse and contamination, abetted by corruption, have caused water supplies to dwindle, user demands to surge and competition to increase for this indispensable resource. With increased water scarcity, corruption risks have risen throughout the sector. To counter these pressures, improved water governance is an essential element, but one that is often underfinanced or overlooked.",

    "excerpt": "The year 2007 marked a milestone in the fight against poverty and corruption. It represented the midway point on the road to meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the ambitious global pledge to end extreme poverty by 2015. It also signalled that ten years had passed since the anti- corruption movement had signed the Lima Declaration, promising to address poverty as part of their efforts.\n\nHowever, actual accomplishments have fallen short of expected progress. In practice, donors and governments still treat poverty and corruption as separate — rather than integral — components of the same strategy. The continued lack of policy integration has undermined efforts to fight both poverty and corruption. Poverty continues to plague more than a half of the world’s citizens, with nearly three billion people living on less than two dollars-a-day. Data on the MDGs show the current development trend not keeping pace with earlier projections. Bottlenecks have developed in certain regions and key countries, creating sizable challenges to meeting the 2015 timeline.",

In some countries, judges who abide by the wishes of senior public officials may be rewarded with modern office equipment, higher quality housing or newer cars. Rather than act as a check on government or economic interests in protecting civil liberties and human rights, judges who have been appointed unfairly may also be more likely to promote their own interests over the rights of the individual. Appointment procedures must therefore be transparent, fair and robust enough to ensure that only those candidates with the highest professional qualifications and standards of personal integrity are allowed to sit on the bench. Fair, independent and transparent appointment processes not only improve judicial independence, but also form part of a system of judicial accountability.",

By perpetuating the ‘abuse of entrusted power for private gain’ – Transparency International’s (TI) definition of corruption – both the bribe payer and bribe taker cause damage in a number of ways. Ultimately, their corrupt dealings create extreme inequity – both in markets and in societies. This report presents highlights of a brand new survey commissioned by TI, the 2008 Bribe Payers Survey.1 It looks in detail at the sources of corruption in the international marketplace, both in terms of where the bribes are paid and by which businesses. Above all, the Bribe Payers Survey illustrates how the supply of corruption is viewed by a global selection of senior business executives, who understand the markets and market pressures in their own countries, some of which drive corruption.",

It contributes to water scarcity, large- scale pollution and the destruction of natural habitats — all factors which make our response to climate change more difficult. If present patterns continue, climate change is expected to fundamentally alter rainfall and river flows, drive up sea levels and put water supplies at risk in many regions. The world will see more frequent and catastrophic storms, floods and droughts with incalculable human consequences. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has already warned that the world’s poorest are going to bear the greatest burden from these shifts. They estimate that more than US $86 billion will be needed annually — for environmental infrastructure and social protection schemes — to overcome the rising inequality unleashed by climate change.",

    "excerpt": "All parents hope for a good education for their children. It is the key to the next generation’s future, particularly for the poor. It equips young citizens with the knowledge and skills to thrive in their country's economy and to participate fully in society. It is a cornerstone of economic and social development, a human right under international law and a constitutional guarantee in most countries.\n\nBut in reality education is often characterised by poor quality and unequal access. For example, a region-wide survey of Africa’s education system showed more than 50 percent of respondents signalling numerous challenges to getting a basic education. Classroom overcrowding, poorly maintained primary schools, absent teachers, lack of textbooks and supplies, and unacceptably high fees and expenses were just some of the problems cited. When it comes to higher education, access in many countries depends more on the parents' purse and social status than the talent, effort and merit of the student. Unfortunately, corruption tends to be one of the principal reasons behind all these problems.",

Such considerations can lead to better designed and targeted policies to combat corruption. They can also create the space for civil society to become engaged and carry out more effective corruption monitoring, which contributes to improvements in policy formulation. However, research findings on the subject have varied over the years and there is still no clear consensus about the inter- relationship between gender and corruption. This paper will explore recent evidence on the topic in an attempt to determine whether and how women have an impact on — and are affected by — corruption.",

It focuses on judges and courts, situating them within the broader justice system and exploring the impact of judicial corruption on human rights, economic development and governance. Two problems are analysed: political interference to pressure judges for rulings in favour of political or economic interests, including in corruption cases; and petty bribery involving court personnel. The result is a thorough analysis of how judicial independence and judicial accountability, two concepts key to the promotion of judicial integrity, can be bolstered to tackle corruption in judicial systems.",

    "excerpt": "The terms and conditions under which judges and court officials work are important in determining their likelihood to engage in corrupt practice. Judiciaries faced with low salaries, poor training and benefits, uncertain security of tenure, or sub-standard administration are unlikely to attract and retain high-quality candidates. Even where able judges and court staff are in place, poor terms and conditions can provide both incentives and opportunities for resorting to corruption. The security of tenure is an essential means of securing judicial independence but, more broadly, conditions of service should provide a professional environment that is a transparent, motivating and safe place for judicial officers to work. Developing decent working environments is therefore a key means of preventing judicial corruption.",

The defence establishment has historically been one of the least open of any government organisation — to public or even intra-governmental scrutiny. The secrecy that necessarily veils some defence activities often extends more widely than can be justified, leaving the sector with little oversight and vulnerable to corruption. As with any form of corruption, abuses of power in the defence sector are not a victimless crime. Every dollar misappropriated represents a waste of resources and creates a more dangerous — and less trustworthy — security environment for all.",

Forestry officials and law enforcement officers who are in the pockets of corrupt logging firms often turn a blind eye to activities that threaten the sustainable management of a forest’s biodiversity. Similarly, fishery inspectors endanger stocks when they accept bribes to ignore official quotas for trawlers. Within countries, poor governance may translate into sub-standard environmental policies, leaving interest groups to determine the common ‘environmental good’. In extreme cases, high-level political corruption can facilitate the wholesale plunder of a country’s natural resources.\n\nThis paper looks at the current findings and discourse surrounding corruption in three renewable natural resources: forestry, fisheries and wildlife.",

They responded to a questionnaire (Appendix B), after consulting with government officials and other knowledgeable persons in their country. They were aided in their work by the valuable Phase I and Phase II country reports prepared by the OECD Working Group on Bribery in the course of its reviews of government compliance with the Convention.

Effective enforcement of the Convention would significantly reduce the supply side of international corruption as most major international companies have their headquarters in signatory states. TI and its national chapters have strongly promoted the adoption of the Convention, its ratification and the passage of implementing legislation by signatory states. TI has also participated actively in the OECD's follow-up monitoring program.\n\nThis Progress Report approaches monitoring from a different perspective and presents a nongovernmental assessment of enforcement of the OECD Convention. It is based on information provided by TI national chapters in twenty-four OECD signatory states, which represent about ninety-five percent of OECD exports. Lawyers and other highly qualified professionals and academics were chosen by these national chapters as expert respondents to a TI questionnaire.",

But all too often political party and campaign finance laws are breached with impunity, in the face of enforcement agencies that are constrained by cumbersome legislation, a lack of independence, insufficient resources or a lack of will. This situation needs remedying because people‘s trust in democracy is eroded when democratically elected leaders fail to comply with laws they themselves design.",

Equally, when a political party resorts to paying for votes rather than focusing on the quality of its campaign message, democracy suffers.",

Its question targeted at levels of corruption in institutions/sectors, for instance, can point to those areas with poor reputations that may be ripe for reform. TI, who commissioned the Global Corruption Barometer from Gallup International, first ran the Global Corruption Barometer in 2003. Country coverage was expanded considerably in 2004, from 48 to 64 countries, and TI will continue to increase the number of countries polled for the Barometer. Over time, TI expects the survey to convey important trends in the way the publics around the world regard corruption in their countries.",

    "excerpt": "Gallup International started conducting an annual Voice of the People survey in 2002. The TI Global Corruption Barometer is derived from a subset of questions commissioned through this survey. This survey investigates a wide variety of areas and issues across many countries. Fieldwork for the survey was conducted in July 2002. Question 1 looks at how seriously respondents believe corruption affects the different spheres of life, such as their personal and family life, the business environment, political life, and the culture and values of society in their country.\nQuestion 2 investigates respondents’ expectations as to how the level of corruption will change over the next three years. Finally, Question 3 asks respondents for their first choice to eliminate corruption from an institution such as courts, political parties, police, the private sector etc.\nRespondents included 19,448 males (47.6%) and 21,390 females (52.4%) from 47 countries. A large percentage of respondents were aged between 30-50 years (42.9%), had some education (71.3%), were receiving a low income (41.9%), and lived in urban communities (66.4%). Close to half of the respondents (47.4%) were employed at the time the survey was conducted.",
